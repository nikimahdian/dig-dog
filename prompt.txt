Objective:
Create a 2D grid layout for a tower defense game, using the provided tiles. The layout should represent the path for enemies, ground for tower placements, towers, projectiles, and obstacles.

Instructions:

Paths and Ground (Tiles):

Sprite Sheet Location: All tile images (PNGs) are located in the folder:
C:\Users\nikim\OneDrive\Desktop\proj4\kenney_tower-defense-top-down\PNG

Tile Mapping:

Path (Brown Tiles): Use the brown tiles for the enemy path. These are represented by the tiles towerDefense_tile002.png and towerDefense_tile003.png.

Ground (Green Tiles): Use green tiles (like towerDefense_tile005.png) for the ground areas.

Tower Placement:

Towers (Red Turret Tiles): Use turret tiles (e.g., towerDefense_tile004.png) to represent the towers along the path.

Obstacles:

Obstacle Tiles: Use rock and tree tiles from the sprite sheet to create obstacles along the path or around the grid.

Projectiles:

Missile Tiles: Represent projectiles using missile or rocket tiles from the sprite sheet.

Final Layout:

The final game layout will resemble the sample image, which is located at:
C:\Users\nikim\OneDrive\Desktop\proj4\kenney_tower-defense-top-down\Sample.png

UI Elements:

The UI elements like health, coins, round, and timer are positioned outside the game grid, to the right of the grid, as in the Sample.png image.

Tile Naming and Placement:

Ensure the tile file names (like towerDefense_tile001.png, towerDefense_tile002.png, etc.) are used accurately to represent each tile in the grid.

Expected Output:

The resulting image should be saved as Sample_new.png at:
C:\Users\nikim\OneDrive\Desktop\proj4\kenney_tower-defense-top-down\Sample_new.png

The generated image should match the layout shown in Sample.png, including the path, towers, projectiles, and UI elements positioned correctly.

Instructions for Saving:

After generating the grid, ensure the image is saved with the correct name in the Sample.png location, ensuring the output is properly placed.
