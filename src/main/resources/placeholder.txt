To complete the game setup:

2. Extract the "Default size" folder containing PNG files like:
   - towerDefense_tile004.png
   - towerDefense_tile005.png
   - towerDefense_tile009.png
   - ... and all other tiles numbered up to ~299

3. Place these PNG files in the "Default size/" directory within src/main/resources/

The game will use these specific PNG files as defined in Config.java's ASSET_MAP.
